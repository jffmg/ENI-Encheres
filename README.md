***ENI-Encheres is a group project by 3 students for the DWWM training programme at ENI Ecole informatique

This was the first project from 2 scheduled for the training programme. We had begun the programme in November 2020 and this project took place in February 2021.
We had 10 days to build a fictitious auction website in Java. The goal was to deliver not a finished product, but a basic website with a number of working functionalities: 
- creating a user account
- signing up to the account
- updating user profile
- deleting user account
- putting articles for sale
- displaying list of articles: for sale, sold, bought, etc.
- sorting articles listed: category, sale status, etc.
- bidding on articles, user credit update
- automated sales conclusion, database update
- automated disconnect from session after a given time

We had some additional constraints:
- error management
- MVC pattern
- handmade custom CSS (no Bootstrap, no CSS preprocessor)
- languages: SQL Server + Java using Jakarta EE & Tomcat server
